This Python program simulates a simple banking system with basic functionality for displaying balance, depositing, and withdrawing money.
It defines three functions: show_Balance, which prints the current balance; 
deposit, which allows the user to input a deposit amount, checks if the amount is valid, and returns the amount or zero if invalid; 
and withdraw, which allows the user to input a withdrawal amount, checks if the amount is valid and if there are sufficient funds, and returns the amount or zero if invalid.
The program initializes the balance to zero and runs in a loop, repeatedly presenting a menu of options to the user.
Depending on the user's choice, it either displays the balance, adds a valid deposit amount to the balance, subtracts a valid withdrawal amount from the balance, 
or exits the loop to end the program.
The loop ensures continuous interaction until the user opts to exit.
